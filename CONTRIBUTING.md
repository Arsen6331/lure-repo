# Contributing to LURE's default repo

1. To create the package, have a look at LURE's [Build Script documentation](https://github.com/Arsen6331/lure/blob/master/docs/packages/build-scripts.md). You can also use any of the existing packages in this repository as examples.
2. Once you've created the package, make sure it follows the [Package Conventions](https://github.com/Arsen6331/lure/blob/master/docs/packages/conventions.md).
3. When you're sure everything is correct, read through the [Adding Packages documentation](https://github.com/Arsen6331/lure/blob/master/docs/packages/adding-packages.md), which will explain how packages are stored in LURE repos and what the submission process will look like.
4. Fix any issues the LURE repo bot reports, and wait for your PR to be merged.
5. You're done! The [LURE web interface](https://lure.arsenm.dev) should automatically update to show your new package. You can share your addition on LURE's [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/linux_user_repository)!
